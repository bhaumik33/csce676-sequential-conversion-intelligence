## 1. Project Overview

This project compares basket-based co-occurrence methods with sequence-aware pattern mining on the OTTO e-commerce dataset. Specifically, it studies how **FP-Growth** and **association rules** differ from **PrefixSpan** when the same shopping sessions are treated either as unordered baskets or as ordered behavioral sequences. The central finding is that preserving session order reveals high-intent behavioral structure that basket-based views miss, especially around directional item relationships and purchase-funnel behavior.

## 2. Main Notebook

The main deliverable for this repository is `main_notebook.ipynb`.

## 3. Research Questions

**Primary question**

- Do sequence-aware methods reveal high-intent behavioral structure that basket-based methods fail to capture?

**Supporting analyses**

- How do different minimum support thresholds change the frequent itemsets recovered by FP-Growth?
- How do confidence and lift emphasize different kinds of association rules in OTTO session baskets?

## 5. Data

This project uses the **OTTO Recommender System** dataset from Kaggle:

- <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/data>

The raw training file is too large to commit, so download instructions and placement details live in `data/README.md`. Cached artifacts are already included in the repo so the notebook can still be reviewed without the 11 GB training file.

## 6. How to Reproduce

This work was developed in **Google Colab (Python 3.11)**.

1. Create a Python 3.11 environment locally or open the notebook in Colab.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Optional: download `otto-recsys-train.jsonl` from Kaggle and place it in the repo root as described in `data/README.md`.
4. Optional: regenerate the cached artifacts:
   ```bash
   python scripts/full_scan.py --train otto-recsys-train.jsonl
   python scripts/build_sample.py --train otto-recsys-train.jsonl
   ```
5. Open `main_notebook.ipynb` and run the notebook. If the raw training file is absent, the notebook uses the committed cache files when available.

## 9. Results Summary

The sequence-aware view adds meaningful structure beyond what basket-based mining can show. In the top basket pairs, **66.7%** are directional rather than symmetric, and **4 of 12** tested top pairs show statistically significant directional imbalance. Sessions that end in orders are enriched for purchase-funnel subsequences such as `clicks -> carts -> orders`, and PrefixSpan recovers **100%** of the top FP-Growth item pairs while also exposing the directional ordering those baskets hide.
